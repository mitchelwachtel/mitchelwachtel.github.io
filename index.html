      need to practice and practing is difficult, so this will be my sandbox.

    <h2>Who is Doc Wach?</h2>
    <p>
      Born in middle GA, I was raised to be a simple and humble math genius. I
      then went on to study mathematics at a local college and teach mathematics
      at high schools in the area. Now I'm trying to learn cs. Pretty neat. I
      have a beautiful wife and a 2 year old son who is cute as hell. It's a
      pretty sweet life.
